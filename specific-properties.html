        This is a paragraph inside a box. The box has an id and inside it is a
        heading element and this paragraph element. The paragraph has no classes
        or ids but has some styles in style.css. The heading has no id but has a
        list of classes. Below this paragraph is an input box with a name
        attribute, a type attribute and an associated button. You can use
        JavaScript and element properties to get access to all of these
        things...take a look at script.js!
